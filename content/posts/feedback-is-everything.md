I have a feeling you can learn more from feedback in an hour than you can from contemplation in a day. When you work in isolation, it's easy to get lost in your own thoughts and assumptions.

External feedback provides:
- New perspectives you hadn't considered
- Quick validation or invalidation of ideas
- Clarity on what's actually important

This is why I'm starting to write more. It's not just about sharing ideas, but about creating a feedback loop for my own thinking.
