I'm updating my site! The old one felt too much like LinkedIn slop and was pretty disconnected to what I wanted my site to be.

### Some changes

1. Way more minimal! 

Revamped the theme and way less stuff to scroll through.
   {{< gif src="/videos/old_website_animation.gif" width="1000px" alt="Previous website's loading screen"  >}}

2. Improved the copy.

More genuine, less LinkedIn-y. Showing things for what they are.

3. I have "writings" now.

My brain has been stuck on consume mode for too long so I'm being silly and writing random stuff.
