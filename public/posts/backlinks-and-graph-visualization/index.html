      <p>In my previous posts, I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="/posts/hello-world">my new blog setup</a> and <a href="/posts/obsidian-inspired">how it&rsquo;s inspired by Obsidian</a>. In this post, I want to dive deeper into graph visualization and how it helps connect ideas.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-connected-posts">What Are Connected Posts?</h2>
<p>When posts link to each other, they create a network of ideas. This concept is one of the foundational ideas behind the original web (and was a key inspiration for Google&rsquo;s PageRank algorithm).</p>
<p>In the context of a personal blog or note-taking system, connected posts provide several benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discover connections</strong>: See which posts relate to the current one</li>
<li><strong>Navigate your content</strong>: Easily move between related ideas</li>
<li><strong>Build knowledge networks</strong>: Create a web of interconnected thoughts</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-connections-work-in-this-blog">How Connections Work in This Blog</h2>
<p>The graph visualization in the sidebar shows how posts are connected. You can see which posts link to each other and explore the relationships between different pieces of content.</p>
<p>This happens automatically when I link between posts. The system tracks these connections and builds a map of relationships between posts.</p>
<h2 id="graph-visualization">Graph Visualization</h2>
<p>The graph visualization shows these connections visually. Each post is represented as a node, and links between posts are shown as edges connecting the nodes.</p>
<p>This visualization helps you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>See the big picture</strong>: Understand how your content is interconnected</li>
<li><strong>Identify clusters</strong>: Find groups of related posts</li>
<li><strong>Discover gaps</strong>: See areas where you might want to create more connections</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-the-graph-is-built">How the Graph Is Built</h2>
<p>The graph view in the sidebar is built using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization. Here&rsquo;s a simplified overview of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system extracts all links from all posts</li>
<li>It builds a data structure representing nodes (posts) and edges (links between posts)</li>
<li>D3.js renders this data as an interactive force-directed graph</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-the-graph">Using the Graph</h2>
<p>You can interact with the graph in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hover over a node</strong> to see the title of the post</li>
<li><strong>Click on a node</strong> to navigate to that post</li>
<li><strong>Drag nodes</strong> to rearrange the graph</li>
<li><strong>Zoom and pan</strong> to explore larger graphs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-for-writing">Benefits for Writing</h2>
<p>This connected approach to writing has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encourages connections</strong>: I&rsquo;m more likely to link related ideas across posts</li>
<li><strong>Reduces silos</strong>: Information isn&rsquo;t isolated in separate posts</li>
<li><strong>Improves navigation</strong>: Readers can explore related content more easily</li>
<li><strong>Builds a knowledge base</strong>: Over time, the blog becomes a network of ideas rather than just a chronological list of posts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try It Yourself</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re viewing this post on my blog, you can see the graph visualization in action in the sidebar. Try clicking on different nodes in the graph to navigate between posts and explore the connections between different pieces of content.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how we can bring some of the powerful features of modern note-taking apps to the web!</p>
