      <p>I&rsquo;m updating my site! The old one felt too much like LinkedIn slop and was pretty disconnected to what I wanted my site to be.</p>
<h3 id="some-changes">Some changes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Way more minimal!</li>
</ol>
<p>Revamped the theme and way less stuff to scroll through.

   
   
   
   
   <figure>
     <img src="/videos/old_website_animation.gif" alt="Previous website&#39;s loading screen" width="1000px" style="max-width: 100%;" />
     
   </figure> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Improved the copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>More genuine, less LinkedIn-y. Showing things for what they are. I don&rsquo;t think anyone even visited the old site, but even <em>I</em> couldn&rsquo;t stand seeing my own site talking about my passions for leveraging cutting-edge technologies championing cross-functional initiatives, building at the intersection of AI, Crypto, Healthcare, Finance, B2B SaaS&hellip;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I have a &ldquo;writings&rdquo; page now.</li>
</ol>
<p>My brain has been stuck on consume mode for so long, I forgot what it&rsquo;s like to actually write something.</p>
<h3 id="how-its-built">How it&rsquo;s built</h3>
<p>I used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and everything&rsquo;s written in HTML and CSS. The posts are written in markdown and I guess Hugo works its magic converting markdown to HTML.</p>
<p>I was about to say this was deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>, and for about 3-ish hours it was. Then I decided to deploy it on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> instead. No real reason, for low traffic static sites like this one I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll make a difference. But I used Vercel so often before, so I thought it&rsquo;d be neat to try something new. How does Cloudflare even make money?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take too long to change it over to Cloudflare. I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer my DNS to Cloudflare</li>
<li>Delete some CNAME records</li>
<li>Set up domain redirecting (<code>www.nicolasliu.com</code> points to <code>nicolasliu.com</code>)</li>
<li>And get confused along the way seeing my browser and <code>curl</code> still load the old website or not work altogether, leading me to a rabbit hole on local DNS caching.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h3>
<p>Hopefully some more writing and sharing interesting stuff I come across online. Could be technical, non-technical, career related, or just dumping what&rsquo;s on my mind.</p>
