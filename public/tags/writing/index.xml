      <description>&lt;p&gt;After using &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for my personal notes for over a year, I decided to bring some of its best features to my blog. In my &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/posts/hello-world&#34;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d be using an Obsidian-inspired setup, and here I want to elaborate on what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-love-about-obsidian&#34;&gt;What I Love About Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has several features that make it exceptional for note-taking and writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown-based&lt;/strong&gt;: Everything is written in simple Markdown, making it portable and future-proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backlinks&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to see which notes link to the current note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph View&lt;/strong&gt;: A visual representation of connections between notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Linking&lt;/strong&gt;: Quick and intuitive way to link between notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-ive-implemented-these-features&#34;&gt;How I&amp;rsquo;ve Implemented These Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve brought these key features to my blog:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for my personal notes for over a year, I decided to bring some of its best features to my blog. In my <a href="/posts/hello-world">first post</a>, I mentioned that I&rsquo;d be using an Obsidian-inspired setup, and here I want to elaborate on what that means.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-love-about-obsidian">What I Love About Obsidian</h2>
<p>Obsidian has several features that make it exceptional for note-taking and writing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Markdown-based</strong>: Everything is written in simple Markdown, making it portable and future-proof.</li>
<li><strong>Backlinks</strong>: The ability to see which notes link to the current note.</li>
<li><strong>Graph View</strong>: A visual representation of connections between notes.</li>
<li><strong>Easy Linking</strong>: Quick and intuitive way to link between notes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-ive-implemented-these-features">How I&rsquo;ve Implemented These Features</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve brought these key features to my blog:</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p>All posts are written in Markdown with YAML front matter, similar to how I write in Obsidian. This makes it easy to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add formatting</li>
<li>Include images</li>
<li>Write code blocks</li>
<li>Structure content with headers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="links-and-connections">Links and Connections</h3>
<p>I can easily create connections between posts using standard Markdown links. For example, I can link to my post about <a href="/posts/backlinks-demo">backlinks and graph visualization</a>.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re reading a post, you can explore related content through the graph visualization, which shows how posts are connected.</p>
<h3 id="graph-visualization">Graph Visualization</h3>
<p>The graph view shows connections between all posts. Nodes represent posts, and edges represent links between them. This gives a visual representation of how ideas connect across different posts.</p>
<h2 id="writing-workflow">Writing Workflow</h2>
<p>My writing workflow is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Markdown file with front matter</li>
<li>Write content using Markdown</li>
<li>Include links to connect to other posts</li>
<li>Add the post to the index.json file</li>
<li>Upload everything to the server</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>This approach has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: The entire system is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No heavy frameworks or databases.</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong>: All content is in Markdown files that can be easily moved or migrated.</li>
<li><strong>Connected</strong>: Graph visualization helps connect ideas across posts.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile-friendly</strong>: The responsive design works well on all devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how the graph visualization works in more detail, check out my post on <a href="/posts/backlinks-demo">backlinks and graph visualization</a>.</p>
